	            While many have the common practice of using horseradish for marror, 
	            it is actually not the recommended food to serve this purpose. Horseradish
	            is not an actual vegetable, it is a root; but more importantly, horseradish
	            is sharp rather than bitter.    
	          </p>
	          <p>
              Horseradish came into popular practice due to the idea that because of its 
              sharpness, it makes one cry; and these tears are supposed to remind one of
              the bitter tears of our ancestors.  While this is certainly a noble aspect
              of the practice that should by no means be discouraged, it is preferable to 
              use a vegetable that emphasizes the bitter taste in one's mouth.
              It is for this reason that romaine lettuce is often suggested.
              However, many opinions feel that romaine lettuce is not sufficiently bitter
              for use as marror, since it is commonly eaten as the main ingredient in salad.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, other salad greens that are less focal elements in common salads 
              make excellent choices for marror. Both endive and raddichio have strong, 
              bitter flavors that stand out when eaten alone, and can be considered 
              recommended vegetables for marror.  
            </p>
            <p>
              One should eat a <i>k'zeiyit</i><small><sup>1</sup></small> of marror after 
              dipping it in <i>charoset</i>.  Note that the intent is to use only a small
              amount of <i>charoset</i> when eating marror, as one should primarily taste 
              the bitter essence of the vegetable.  It is widely suggested that after dipping,
              one should actually shake off the <i>charoset</i>, since the act of dipping 
              is merely symbolic rather than a fundamental aspect of the commandment to eat 
              marror.

	            <sup>1</sup>Most opinions agree that one may rely on the lenient 
	            measurements of a <i>k'zeiyit</i> for the purpose of eating marror, 
	            which is approximately 19 grams. Notably, it is much easier to eat
	            19 grams worth of endive or raddichio than fresh horseradish.
