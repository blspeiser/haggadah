            After one has concluded eating the prescribed amount of bitter vegetables,

              Most halachic authorities indicate that one should make their sandwich 
              from one <i>k'zeiyit</i> of matzah with one <i>k'zeiyit</i> of marror, 
              folding the matzah over so that it covers both sides of the bitter vegetables. 
              However, all authorities recognize the difficulty of eating yet another 
              <i>k'zeiyit</i> of matzah and/or marror and suggest more lenient approaches, 
              since Koraich is largely symbolic rather than a directly fulfillment a commandment.
              If necessary, a qualified halachic authority can be consulted to determine the 
              proper guidelines.

            We do what Hillel did to commemorate what we used to do when the 
            Holy Temple was still standing: he would combine the Paschal Lamb, the 
            matzah and bitter vegetables, and then eat them together.  He based this 
            on an interpretation of the following verse: 
            "They shall eat it [the Paschal Lamb] with matzah and bitter vegetables."
            This implies one must eat them not only in the same meal, but at exactly 
            the same time.
