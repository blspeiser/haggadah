	            The Afikoman is the symbolic equivalent to eating the Paschal Lamb during the
	            Passover Seder.  As a result, there is great significance attached to it as
	            well as guidelines intended to reflect the laws that were followed during the 
	            era when the Paschal Lamb was actually eaten. 
	          </p>
	          <p>
	            Because of this, the Afikoman should be the last food consumed for the evening, 
	            and should be eaten before halachic midnight, which varies depending on the
	            time of year. If one is still eating and halachic midnight arrives, one should
	            eat a piece of matzah at that moment with the intent to fulfill the requirement 
	            to eat the Paschal Lamb before midnight, and then after finishing their meal, eat 
	            the Afikoman so that matzah remains as the last food eaten during the evening.
	          </p>
	          <p>  
	            After partaking the Afikoman, one should refrain from eating; however, one may
	            still consume wine, grape juice, or water.</p>  
            <p>
              Similar to the obligation to eat matzah and marror, it is recommended that one 
              eat a <i>k'zeiyit</i> of the Afikoman. If there is not enough Afikoman (or it 
              is misplaced) then any matzah will suffice. If one feels that they cannot eat
              this suggested quantity, it is advisable to at least chew the Afikoman for a 
              significant quantity of time to insure that one adequately tastes the matzah.
              Similar to all other cases at the Seder, one should consult a local respected 
              halachic authority to determine the proper practice.
