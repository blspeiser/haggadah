            The Seder continues with Karpas &mdash; <br/>which is not quite an appetizer but can serve
            to whet one's appetite.

            The ritual of Karpas involves eating a vegetable dipped in saltwater, 
            representing the many tears shed by our ancestors during their slavery in Egypt. 
            While all vegetables are acceptable for use in Karpas, it is recommended that
            one use a green vegetable, to additionally symbolize Passover as <i>Chag HaAviv</i>,
            the Festival of Spring, and the new growth and new life that the season brings. 
            For this reason, many customarily use parsely, celery, or other green vegetables 
            that may be growing at this time of the year.

            Most Jewish legal authorities recommend that one only eat a relatively insubstantial 
            amount for Karpas.  The priniciple reason is that one should save their appetite for 
            the matzah which will be eaten later.
