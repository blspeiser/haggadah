            The main meal is served. It is customary to serve meat, fish, or poultry 
            in accordance with the general obligations of a festive meal.  Individuals 
            may drink wine if they so choose; however, any wine consumed during the meal
            will not count towards the overall obligation to drink four cups of wine 
            during the Passover Seder.

            One should not eat excessively, as there will be an obligation to eat
            the Afikomen at the end of the meal, and one is not supposed to eat 
            the Afikomen if they are bloated.  In addition, the meal should not 
            take an excessive amount of time, as the Afikomen needs to be eaten 
            prior to <i>chatzot</i>, the halachic definition of midnight.
