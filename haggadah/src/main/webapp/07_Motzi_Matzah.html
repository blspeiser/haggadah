	            The commandment to eat matzah at the Seder is the only remaining 
	            mitzvah in which eating a particular item is considered the fulfillment
	            of a biblical obligation.  In the current era, any other commandment to
	            eat a particular food (such as the bitter vegetables, which will be eaten 
	            next) are incumbent upon us only at a rabbinically-mandated level, so that we will 
	            not forget how our ancestors were able to fulfill the commandment to its 
	            utmost degree.
            </p>  
            <p>
              Because of this uniquely high degree of obligation, halachic authorities 
              stress the gravity of the commandment to eat matzah; and thus provide
              conservative guidelines as to how much and how quickly one should eat matzah 
              in order to satisfy even the most demanding interpretations in Jewish law.  
              Therefore, the prevalent opinion is that one should eat a measurement of two 
              <i>zeitim</i><small><sup>1</sup></small> in a timespan of <i>k'dei achilat 
              pras</i><small><sup>2</sup></small>, in order to satisfy all opinions.  However, 
              the precise definition of these Talmudic measurements is unclear; and 
              thus there is further debate in which opinions are equally conservative in 
              their estimates.  
            </p>
            <p>
              In practice, it is advisable that one consult with their local respected 
              halachic authority to determine the precise amount to be consumed, and how 
              long one may take to finish eating that required amount.  If for some reason
              one has not been able to inquire or is physically incapable of consuming
              the suggested amount, one should steadily eat matzah until one's stomach 
              begins to feel as though one has eaten. In effect, this usually entails eating at least three quarters of a matzah 
              over the span of at least five minutes; which is likely to be the smallest 
              amount of time it takes for one's stomach to indicate that it is no longer 
              hungry.  Regardless of the quantity and time required to fulfill the obligation, 
              it is clear that one cannot fulfill their obligation by eating a small, 
              cracker-sized quantity of matzah.

	            <sup>1</sup>The reason for eating two <i>zeitim</i> is so that the first 
	            <i>k'zeiyit</i> will fulfill one's obligation to eat 'bread' on the holiday
	            (a generic obligation that applies to all festivals), and the second  
	            <i>k'zeiyit</i> to fulfill the biblically-mandated commandment to eat matzah.
            </p>
            <p>
	            Sephardic authorities generally maintain that a singular 
	            <i>k'zeiyit</i> is 27 grams, therefore two <i>zeitim</i> would be 54 grams.
	            Ashkenazic authorities base a <i>k'zeiyit</i> on volume rather than weight,
	            and have much more varied opinions as to the precise definition; although 
	            the commonly accepted measurement in weight for a <i>k'zeiyit</i> is 29 grams;
	            with two <i>zeitim</i> being 58 grams.  Note that a single sheet of 
	            machine-made matzah is typically around 33 grams. 
	          </p>
	          <p>  
		          Almost all authorities acknowledge the difficulty of eating this much matzah, 
		          and suggest that at bare minimum, one should try to eat 19 grams, which is 
		          slightly less than two-thirds of a machine-made matzah. However, individuals 
		          should consult a local respected halachic authority for more information and 
		          to determine the precise proper practice.

	            <sup>2</sup>The widely accepted timespan for <i>k'dei achilat pras</i> is
	            approximately 4 minutes.  However, this is the standard measurement that 
	            is used for commonplace halachic considerations; and may not be suitable
	            with regard to eating matzah, where the convention is to be particularly 
	            strict.  Some opinions indicate that when eating matzah, one should eat the
	            required amount within even 2 minutes; others are skeptical, arguing that 
	            this may be physically impossible, especially given the opinions that suggest
	            one need to eat almost two full sheets of matzah. 
	          </p>
	          <p>  
	            Some authorities maintain that as long as one does not take a break from 
	            eating, one may take as long as 18 minutes.  Additionally, many feel that 
	            one need not rush while eating, which may be a factor into the timespan.  
	            As mentioned in the previous note, for those interested in the technicalities, 
	            one should seek out a qualified halachich authority.
