            The plate of three matzot is retrieved, and the middle matzah is pulled 
            out and broken in half.  The larger of the two halves is set aside as 
            the Afikoman, and will be used later in the evening.  The smaller of the
            two is returned to the plate of matzot, in between the two whole matzot.

            Unlike most festival meals, where it is customary to use two loaves of bread 
            to fulfill the general concept of <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> (literally <i>doubled bread</i>), 
            on Passover we use three matzot.  One reason is simply mathematical: if one breaks one 
            matzah for Yachatz, two whole matzot are still required in order to fulfill <i>Lechem 
            Mishneh</i>; hence the need for three matzot.

            The main purpose of Yachatz is to set the tone for the beginning of Maggid:
            that while the Jews were enslaved in Egypt, their national character and 
            spirit was cracked, broken, shattered, split - and the process of the 
            redemption was to pick up the remains of their spirit and find a future
            together.  For this reason, the larger broken piece is set aside for the 
            Afikoman, to serve as a reminder that in the end, we always leave behind 
            the remnants of our troubles and move toward greatness.
