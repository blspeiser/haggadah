            Unlike most hand washing rituals, Urchatz mandates that no blessing be recited.  
            The <i>halachic</i> origin of this particular ritual is related to complicated laws of 
            <i>Tumah v'Tahara</i><small><sup>1</sup></small> that are no longer applicable in the 
            modern era; and is in fact not at all related to the laws of Passover.<small><sup>2</sup></small>
            </p>
            <p> 
            However, the author(s) of the Haggadah chose specifically to codify the inclusion of this obscure 
            ritual practice for the very obscurity that surrounds it.  The true value of Urchatz in the Seder is 
            not that it fulfills obscure halachic requirements for which few understand; but rather that it is 
            in-and-of-itself a symbol of obscurity.
            </p>
            <p> 
            The purpose of Urchatz is clear: the Seder is designed, organized, and codified to pique our curiousity.
            The ambigous relevance of Urchatz is deliberate; it forces to question it and its origin.  Through this, 
            the Hagaddah sets the tone and for the remainder of the Seder: participants should be inquisitive. All who
            experience the Seder are encouraged to ask questions, to delve deeper into the meaning of the Hagaddah text,
            and to not merely read the Hagaddah but instead learn it.

            <sup>1</sup><i>Tumah</i> is most often poorly translated into English using nomenclature 
            such as "impure", "unclean", or "defiled".  All of these are improper; <i>Tumah</i> is 
            actually more of an "essence of death", or a "lack of life".  Examples that demonstrate 
            this concept are the fact that a human corpse is the strongest source of <i>Tumah</i>, and
            that various divinely-caused illnesses such as <i>Tzara'at</i> (most often mistranslated 
            as leprosy) and <i>Zav</i> (another divinely-caused disease) result in the inability to procreate.

            <sup>2</sup>The obscure law of Urchatz is related to washing one's hands before dipping  
            edibles into a liquid.  This is because edibles can only contract <i>Tumah</i> after they 
            have been exposed to one of seven liquids (called <i>machshirin</i>): dew, water, wine, 
            oil, blood, milk, and honey.  When any of these liquids touch food, the food is then 
            susceptible to <i>Tumah</i> contamination. In ancient times, it was commonplace to not 
            wash vegetables until immediately prior to eating, so that they would remain incapable 
            of contracting <i>Tumah</i>. Because most meals start with the traditional breaking of 
            bread - which is preceded by a ritual washing of the hands - there is no special concern that
            <i>Tumah</i> will be transmitted to the vegetables that are washed immediately prior 
            to consumption.
            </p>
            <p> 
            However, the Sages understood that there are occasions where one eats vegetables dipped in 
            liquid outside the context of a meal, so it is possible that one's hands could be <i>Tamei</i>.
            As a result, the Sages instituted that one wash their hands before dipping foods, so that 
            one's hands would not be <i>Tamei</i> when they dip their food in liquid. In this fashion, 
            the foodstuffs would remain <i>Tahor</i>, and therefore <i>Kohanim</i> at the table could 
            eat without concern for making themselves <i>Tamei</i>; which could interfere with other 
            aspects of their daily rituals.  
            </p>
            <p>
            As noted, the origins of these laws were established in a time when everyday individuals
            were concerned about their status as <i>Tamei</i> or <i>Tahor</i>.  Nowadays, however, 
            these concerns are of less general relevance.  Nonetheless, their inclusion in the Seder 
            inspires a foray into complex areas of Jewish law, and as noted in the general commentary; 
            this sets the appropriate tone for the evening as we are encouraged to ask questions.
            </p>
            <p>
            By deliberately including an obscure ritual from outside the context of Passover itself, the 
            Haggadah asks us to expand our horizons and look more broadly at all Jewish ceremonies and 
            customs with an inquisitive eye. What do they mean? What are they supposed to teach us?
            What feelings are they supposed to invoke? From the very beginning of the Seder, with just a 
            simple hand-washing ritual, the Haggadah aims to broaden the scope of self-reflection and 
            engagement with our history, customs, and laws.
